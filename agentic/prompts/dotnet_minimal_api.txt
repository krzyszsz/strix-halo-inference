Create a minimal ASP.NET Core API (net8.0) with one GET endpoint:

  GET /sum?x=3&y=4

It should return JSON like: {"sum": 7}.

Include:
- Program.cs using minimal API.
- A .csproj targeting net8.0.
- A Dockerfile that builds and runs the app on port 8080.
- A brief README.md with run instructions.

Make sure the Dockerfile uses multi-stage build with the official mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk and aspnet runtime images.
